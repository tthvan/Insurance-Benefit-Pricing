# Group Benefits Experience Analysis (Brief Report)  

## 1. Executive Summary
Overall experience for the group is **favourable for Health and Dental** benefits, with experience costs consistently **below manual calculations across all classes and regions**.  
However, **STD and LTD show signs of unfavourable experience in a few segments**, specifically by **Class A** (Office workers), while Class B (Field workers) are mainly favourable due to limited claims recorded.

---

## 2. Exposure Overview
- Ontario has the largest share of exposures (covered lives).  
- Class A consistently represents a larger portion of exposure compared to Class B.  
- Health and Dental experience results are considered **reliable** given exposure size, while **STD and LTD results should be interpreted with caution** due to lower claim amounts and higher volatility.

## 3. Experience vs Manual
*(Figure 1: Average Manual Cost per Life vs Experience Cost per Life)*

### Health
- Experience cost per life ranges from **~36 to 40**, compared to manual assumptions of **85–100**.  
- Exp/Manual ratios remain consistently low (**~0.38–0.44**) across all regions and classes.

**Interpretation:**  
Health experience is **strongly favourable and stable**, suggesting conservative pricing assumptions. No corrective action is required.

### Dental
- Experience cost per life fluctuates around **17–19**, compared to manual assumptions of **35–42**.  
- Exp/Manual ratios range between **~0.41–0.51**.

**Interpretation:**  
Dental experience is **favourable and predictable**, with patterns are consistent across regions. No corrective action is required.

## 4. Short-Term Disability (STD) — Key Risk Driver  
*(Figure 2: Average Exp/Manual Ratio by Region and Class)*

STD experience shows patterns among **segmentation by class**:

- **Class A**  
  - Unfavourable across all regions:  
    - ON: Exp/Manual ratio = **1.41**  
    - QC: Exp/Manual ratio = **1.89**  
    - BC: Exp/Manual ratio = **1.63**  
  - The high experience:manual ratios are driven by **claim amounts**, not pricing discounts in this case.

- **Class B**  
  - Experience remains favourable across all regions, with **no claims observed** in QC and BC.

**Interpretation:**  
STD losses are **concentrated within Class A**, particularly in **Quebec**, which might indicate a **local risk issue**.

---

## 5. Long-Term Disability (LTD) — Volatility Observed
- Unfavourable LTD experience is observed **only in Class A – Ontario**, with an Exp/Manual ratio of **~1.64**.  
- All other Class × Region segments show **no LTD claims** over the period.

**Interpretation:**  
LTD experience lacks reliability with low exposures level. Observed losses are likely driven by **low frequency volatility** rather than reliable patterns.

---

## 6. Key Drivers Identified
1. **STD claims within Class A**, highest and more highlighted in Quebec  
2. **Concentration of LTD losses** in a single segment (Class A – ON)  
3. Strong and consistent **favourable experience in Health and Dental**

---

## 7. Recommendations
- **STD**: Consider a **targeted rate adjustment ** for **Class A**, particularly in Quebec.  

- **LTD**: Monitor experience over an additional period to assess credibility.

- **Health & Dental**: Maintain current pricing policies.
